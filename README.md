# stanford-aa203-project

Run the following from this directory:
* python3 sindy/run_sindy.py
* python3 main.py

The first command will run the (simplified version of) the SINDy method for System Identification.

The second command will run iLQR, flat-system trajectory-generation etc.
Run the first command first: it will generate a module which is imported by the second one (and does not exist in this repo).
